We eat waffles while we code this robot.


I will not write "a bit about myself." That is personal information that no one needs to know. Ranting about hating to give away personal information will help me learn about commiting change just as well as giving away my personal information, but without negative consequences. Thank you. Goodbye.

P.S. Space waffles are far superior than Earth waffles.
