# 2019_Robot_Project
Since our programming team was new, in the off season we refactored our code from the 2019 season to allow our new members to learn how our code is set up. This code was meant for our Beta Robot and is a simplified version of our 2019 Alpha Robot code. It does not contain code for our elevator.
